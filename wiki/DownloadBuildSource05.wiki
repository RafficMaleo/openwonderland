==Open Wonderland v0.5: Download, Configure, Build and Run from the Source Code==

This page describes how to download, configure, build and run Open Wonderland v0.5 from the source code. Generally only software developers will use Wonderland in this way -- to do so, you should be familiar and comfortable with building open-source software from the command-line using *ant* or via an IDE.

The Open Wonderland source code comes bundled with most of the software you will need, including an up-to-date version of Java 3D and Project Darkstar.

===Requirements===

Wonderland is set up as a Netbeans project that includes ant scripts for running the various Wonderland services. If you're using Netbeans you can check out and compile the project directly. If not, you need to install the following tools if not already present on your system:

   1 Have Java SE 6 installed on your system.
   1 Have *ant* version 1.7.1 installed on your system (http://ant.apache.org/).
   1 Have *subversion* installed on your system (http://subversion.tigris.org/), if you plan to install the optional add-on modules.
   
If you wish to use the command-line in addition to Netbeans, be aware that Netbeans does not add *ant* to your path. You will need to do this manually.
If you are using Netbeans, the _wonderland_ workspace is setup as a Netbeans project. The Netbeans community has published tutorials on using Subversion ([http://www.netbeans.org/kb/60/ide/subversion.html here]). You may invoke
the *ant* targets (specified below) directly from Netbeans.

*NOTE:* In general, you will need to set the *ANT_OPTS* environment variable to *-XX:MaxPermSize=900m* (otherwise you will likely get an !OutOfMemoryError when trying to compile and run). For example, if you are using Bash, you can set the *ANT_OPTS* environment variable using *export ANT_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=900m"*.

===Download the _wonderland_ workspace===

The _wonderland_ workspace contains all of the source code and any libraries that Open Wonderland depends upon and is available via *svn*. It contains its own ant-based build system. This tutorial assumes you will place this workspace inside of a directory named _~/src/0.5_, although you are free to place it anywhere. (Note that '~' denotes your home directory).

====Download the trunk====

The most recent version of the code is called the _trunk_. To download the source in the trunk, inside a terminal window from your home directory, after you have created the _src/0.5/_ subdirectory:

{{{
% cd ~/src/0.5
% mkdir trunk
% cd trunk
% svn checkout http://openwonderland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk wonderland
}}}

====Download User Preview 3====

If you wish to work with a more stable version of Open Wonderland, you may download the most recent "preview" release. To download the User Preview 3, inside a terminal window from your home directory, after you have created the _src/0.5/_ subdirectory:

{{{
% cd ~/src/0.5
% mkdir 0.5-preview3
% cd 0.5-preview3
% svn checkout https://openwonderland.googlecode.com/svn/branches/0.5-preview3 wonderland
}}}

===Building Open Wonderland===

You can build the Open Wonderland source code by running the *ant* command in a terminal window:

{{{
% ant
}}}

===Running Open Wonderland===

You run Open Wonderland by using *ant* targets provided by the build system. When you run Wonderland, you are really starting a web server on your machine. This web server provides a number of functions: it supports a web-based administration interface that lets you start/stop the Wonderland server and associated services.

To run wonderland, in the _wonderland_ directory:

{{{
% ant run-server
}}}

Once you start Wonderland, you can administer the server via a web-based user interface. Please visit the following tutorial for more details:
