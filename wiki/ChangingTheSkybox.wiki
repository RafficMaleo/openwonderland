#summary Method for developers to change the Open Wonderland skybox.

=Changing the Skybox=
*By Matthew Schmidt*


Here's a how-to for replacing the default skybox.

Caveat: AFAIK, you have to rebuild the Wonderland source code to get this to work. This will not work if you are using the binary build.


1. Download or build a skybox.

  * Pre built skyboxes can be found here: http://www.3delyvisions.com
  * You're on your own if you build it yourself. Plenty of tutorials and software is available online.

2. Navigate to the skybox directory:

{{{
%yourWonderlandDirectory%/wonderland/modules/world/defaultenvironment/art/skybox1
}}}

3. Make backup copies of all your existing skybox images

{{{
     -in bash:

          $ mkdir backup

          $ cp *.jpg ./backup
}}}

4. Name the new skybox files the same names as the old skybox files

The default Wonderland skybox names correspond to the following
directions:

{{{
	1.jpg = right
	2.jpg = back
	3.jpg = left
	4.jpg = front
	5.jpg = bottom
	6.jpg = top
}}}

5. Resize the new skybox images to dimensions 512 x 512

6. Overwrite the old skybox image files by copying the new skybox
images, which you renamed and resized, to the skybox directory. :

{{{
%yourWonderlandDirectory%/wonderland/modules/world/defaultenvironment/art/skybox1
}}}

NOTE: Many pre-built skyboxes do not have a bottom image. Since the
bottom image is typically not seen in-world, you do not have to
replace it. Just leave the old skybox image.

7. Rebuild Wonderland (ant clean, ant, ant run-server)

8. Launch and enjoy your new skybox!
