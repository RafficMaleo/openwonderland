      Cells provide spatialised geometry, behavior and network support for world content.
  <p>
      Each Cell in the world has a local bounds defined by the developer. The local bounds
      must encapsulate all the geometry for that cell, if the geometry changes size
      or position then it may be necessary to update the bounds of the cell. The developer is 
      responsible for ensuring that the local bounds always encapsulates the geometry.
      Cell bounds are defined in Cell local coordinates. The local bounds do not have
      to encapsulate the bounds of the cells children.
  </p>
  <p>
      The bounds of a cell can overlap the bounds of it's sibling cells.
  </p>
  
  <p>
      getComputedWorldBounds returns a bounds object that encapsulates this
      cell and all it's child cell bounds. The computedWorldBounds is only updated
      periodically so there may be some lag in these bounds encapsulating children 
      that have changing bounds. The timing of updates is not strongly defined
      at this time in order to allow exploration of various optimisations in 
      the future.
  </p>
     
  <p>
      getCacheVWBounds returns the cell bounds in Virtual World coordinates. This
      call is only valid for live cells.
