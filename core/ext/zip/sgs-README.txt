The Project Darkstar zip files included here are temporary pre-release files. 
They have been built from the svn HEAD of Project Darkstar and have not been
through any of the rigorous testing applied to a formal Project Darkstar
release. As soon as a formal release is available we will switch to it.

As a result of this please do not summit any bugs directly to the Project 
Darkstar team or use this version for any purpose other than
building and initial porting of Wonderland 0.5 code.
