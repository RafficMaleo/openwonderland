<P>The Wonderland virtual world platform provides an open, extensible
framework on which users can develop and deploy entire virtual worlds
or applications that can run within an existing Wonderland virtual
world.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>View</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>A View provides a view into the virtual world, having properties
of at least location and look direction. Avatars and Cameras are
examples of a view. The view allows the client application to
establish a view into the virtual world. In many cases this view
associated with an avatar, in which case the avatar, through the cell
system, will control the view. However on smaller devices, or simpler
interfaces, the client may choose not to have a local avatar in which
case the view can be controlled through the View Handler.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Handlers</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The Handlers provide a high level communication infrastructure for
Wonderland subsystems. Any subsystem which can provide a stand alone
service to the user will use the Handler mechanism to encapsulate all
communication. This allows client applications to easily select the
Wonderland subsystems that are appropriate for the users current mode
of operation or client device capabilities. For the example the IM,
Audio chat and Cells are all subsystems that are optional, and each
provides it's own handler. The client side implementation of a
specific Handler is a singleton and they must be correctly
initialised (by calling attach in the session login) before use.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Cell</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The cell system provides the structure of the virtual world. Each
cell is a volume in the 3D world described as either a bounding box
or sphere, arranged in a tree. The tree provides a spatial
organization and requires that the bounds of any child cell is fully
enclosed within the bounds of the parent cell. Cells can provide
either/both content and a communication channel to the client.
Depending on the client capabilities (as specified in the {@see
org.jdesktop.wonderland.common.cell.ClientCapabilities} class) each
cell can provide it's own client side representation by specifying
the client side class used to represent the cell (see {@see
org.jdesktop.wonderland.server.cell.CellMO#getClientCellClassName(ClientCapabilities)}),
the same mechanism also provides for multiple communication channels
allowing, for example, support for clients with varying network
bandwidth capabilities. The security system in Wonderland can be used
to provide varying level of access to any cell (and it's children) to
a particular user.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Cell
Cache</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Every View in the virtual world has a Cell Cache. The Cache is
responsible for determining which cells are available to a user.
There is a server portion of the cell cache, and if the client
supports it, a client portion. The server Cell Cache ( {@see
org.jdesktop.wonderland.server.cell.CellCacheMO} ) is responsible for
determining which cells are potentially visible to a client use a
combination of locality to the view and security policy. The client
is notified as cells are moved into and out of the potentially
visible set. The client Cell Cache then computes which state each
cell should be in as the view moves and takes the appropriate
rendering action.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Wonderland
Session</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Each client application connected to the wonderland server is
represented by a Session on both the client and the server. The
session handles the login and also provides a single point for
accessing all the handler required for that session. A single user
can have multiple concurrent sessions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>User</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Wonderland representation of a real person. Users have a unique
username and a real world name. They also have a security context
which provides the point of control for the security features within
Wonderland.<!-- Document   : package
