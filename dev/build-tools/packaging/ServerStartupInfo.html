  <h1><center>Darkstar Server Startup Information</center></h1>  
<p>
When the darkstar server is started, there are many messages logged
and it is difficult for a new user to determine if it came up
successfully or not.

There shouldn't be any exceptions in the server log.
<p>
Important messages you should see:
<p>
INFO: The Kernel is ready, version: 0.9.4-r3093
<p>
Other messages which are harmless:
<p>
DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK: Locker killed to resolve a deadlock
<p> 
When clients disconnect there may be an IOException thrown
showing that the connection has been reset.  This is harmless.
<p>
If the darkstar server is started before the voice bridge is started,
then messages may appear indicating that there are no voice bridges 
available.  This is not a problem.  The server will be notified
when a voice bridge comes online.
