<CENTER><H3>Project Wonderland 0.5 Licensing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<B>What license has Sun chosen for Project Wonderland v0.5?</B>
<BR><BR>
Sun has chosen to license Project Wonderland v0.5 under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 with the "Classpath" exception. You may find the original text of the GPL v2 license using the following link:
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public License v2</a></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
The text of the "Classpath" exception to the GPL v2 license is:
<BR>
<blockquote>
"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.  are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words "Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.  
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
</blockquote>
<BR><BR>
<B>Why has Sun chosen to license Project Wonderland v0.5 under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the "Classpath" Exception?</B>
<BR><BR>
Sun wants community members and commercial vendors to share any improvements and/or bug fixes they make to the Project Wonderland code base itself. The GPL v2 license supports this objective.
<BR><BR>
New in Project Wonderland v0.5 is a well-defined "module" system. Third-parties may develop modules for Project Wonderland that incorporate custom world designs and extensions to Project Wonderland using its APIs. We want everyone, both non-commercial community members and commercial vendors, to be able to build and redistribute these proprietary world designs and extensions to Project Wonderland as they see fit. The addition of the "Classpath" exception to the GPL v2 license allows developers to license their independently developed modules that are not derivatives of and do not contain portions of Project Wonderland code as they see fit under license terms other than GPLv2.  Modules need not be licensed under the GPL v2 license terms, unless they are derivatives of or contain poritions of Project Wonderland code.
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>What is a module in Project Wonderland v0.5? What are some examples of modules?</B>
<BR><BR>
In Project Wonderland v0.5, a module contains a collection of artwork and other media, code, scripts, and world definitions. They are packaged and distributed as "archive" files that are deployed to Project Wonderland installations. Modules may be used for many purposes, for example, to bundle a collection of 3D model artwork to distribute and allow others to use. They also may contain code that extends the functionality of Project Wonderland. Examples include independently developed custom "cell" types and code that runs in either/both the Project Wonderland server and Project Wonderland clients. This code invokes the Project Wonderland APIs and typically extends Java classes and implements Java interfaces that are part of the Project Wonderland core software library, but does not consist of modifications or portions of the Project Wonderland core software nor is based directly on the Project Wonderland core software library itself. We have designed Project Wonderland v0.5 so that most changes and new functionality can be made with modules, rather than modifying the core library code.
<BR><BR>
By way of example, consider a module that implements a new "poster" cell type that displays image content that is downloaded from the web during run-time. This module contains code that runs on both the Wonderland clients and server. To implement this new cell type, you extend classes and implement interfaces that are part of the Project Wonderland APIs. For example, you would extend the base "Cell" classes and implement interfaces to send and receive messages between the client-side and server-side code. Because you are neither modifying the Project Wonderland core libraries themselves nor directly using any of the Project Wonderland core library code in your module code, you are not obligated to license under the terms of the Project Wonderland GPLv2 license.
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>I am experimenting with Project Wonderland and modified its core libraries. Must I make my modifications available?</B>
<BR><BR>
It depends. If you have not redistributed the software outside of your organization, then you are not required to make your modifications to the Project Wonderland core libraries publicly available -- the license terms of GPL v2 apply only when the software is distributed outside of your organization. It does not apply when you are merely using the code (or modified code) internally within your organization on its facilities.
<BR><BR>
If you have redistributed the core Project Wonderland libraries that you have modified, then the GPL v2 license terms apply. (See "Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification" in the GNU General Public License v2). Note that allowing users located outside your organization and off its facilities to connect to your Wonderland server over the Internet constitutes a distribution of the Project Wonderland software, because as part of the process, clients download your modified Project Wonderland core libraries.
<BR><BR>
To continue the example above, now consider that in order to implement the "poster" cell type, you need to add functionality to the Project Wonderland core library classes (e.g. the base "Cell" class). The GPL v2 licensing terms apply to these modifications if you have distributed your modified Project Wonderland software outside of your organization.
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Is Sun going to also modify the Project Wonderland v0.4 license to include the "Classpath" exception?</B>
<BR><BR>
No, Project Wonderland v0.4 will remain licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Is the Project Wonderland code available, or will it be, under a non-GPL license?</B>
<BR><BR>
The Project Wonderland codebase is not generally available under a non-GPL license; however, it may be possible for you to obtain such a license should you need one. Please contact <a href="mailto:wonderland-commercial-license@sun.com">wonderland-commercial-license@sun.com</a> if you need a non-GPL license.
