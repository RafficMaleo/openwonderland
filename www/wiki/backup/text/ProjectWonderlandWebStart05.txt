---++++ %BLUE%Introduction%ENDCOLOR%

Support for Java Web Start is built into Project Wonderland v0.5. The Wonderland server automatically supports launching clients from Java Web Start when you compile Project Wonderland from the source code (or from binary releases in the future). With Java Web Start, clients only need to open a URL in a web browser, and as long as Java SE 6 is installed on their system, the Project  Wonderland client will be automatically downloaded and launched. 

---++++ %BLUE%The Project Wonderland Server URL%ENDCOLOR%

When you start the Project Wonderland server, a web server is started which enables users to launch the client. This web page defaults to port 8080. For example, if the host name of your server is www.company.com, then the URL of the Project Wonderland client page will be http://www.company.com:8080. If you are unsure what the host name of your machine is, you can use the IP address of your server instead. 

When you start the server, it displays a message with the URL of the web server. For example: 

<verbatim>
     [java] -----------------------------------------------------------
     [java] Wonderland web server started successfully.
     [java] Log files are in /Users/me/.wonderland-server/0.5-dev/log
     [java] Web server running on http://129.148.173.164:8080/
     [java] -----------------------------------------------------------
</verbatim>

---++++ %BLUE%Displaying the Java Console%ENDCOLOR%

Before launching the client via Java Web Start, it is recommended that you turn on the Java console, which displays log messages for the client. If you run into an issue, this log will help determine the cause of the problem. To turn on the Java console:

If you open the URL in a web browser, you should see the page below. Click the "Launch Wonderland 0.5" button to launch the client. It only needs to download the client software once; future attempts will use a cached version of the software. (click the image for a full-sized version).
