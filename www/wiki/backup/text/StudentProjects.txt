---+!! Wonderland Project Ideas for Students (or Others)

This is a list of potential projects for students or anyone else interested in extending Wonderland. The projects are listed by category with a level-of-effort indicator from small to large in parentheses after the project name. The level of effort that a project involves is based on many factors, the most important of which is the experience of the developer or project team. In addition, some ideas can be expanded to encompass more functionality and other ideas can be simplified. The level-of-effort indicators below should be considered relative. A "small" level of effort means that the level of effort is smaller than the level of effort required by a "medium" or "large" project. Each project is marked with one or more keywords. You can use your browser's "find in page" feature if you are interested in projects that match one of the [[#Keywords][keywords]]. 

Anyone in the community is invited to add projects to this list. Please use the [[#Template][template]] provided below.

| *Description* | Show the effect of general relativity on time and distance. This could be an in-world black hole which implies a strong gravitational field.  As an avatar approaches the black hole, it would become taller and thinner.  Also, since time slows down, the avatar approaching the black hole would hear another person's audio speed up.  The avatar far away from the black hold would hear the audio of the avatar near the black hole becoming slower and slower. We'd have to make sure the avatar doesn't go too close to the black hole or it will disappear forever.  :-)  %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

| *Description* | The goal would be to implement a  "virtual orrery" which simulates the solar system (maybe with only 4 planets). Users could control parameters such as planet mass and gravitational constant to experiment. These controls could be provided via a swing panel or a !Widget3D control box (Note: !Widget3D is the name of a prototype 3D widget library I muse about from time to time.). Users could apply a force to a particular planet by moving a "force vector" arrow widget. You could also add a visualization of keplers law of equal areas/times.%EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

| *Description* | In high school AP Psychology classes and college-level introductory classes, students are often introduced to psychology concepts through live demonstrations. This project involves creating a virtual psychology demonstration world in which students can interact with other live students as well as with simulated characters to observe phenomena such as perception, memory, conditioning, and learning. For any students interested in this project, we will try to pair you with an AP Psychology teacher. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

| *Description* | Simple eco-systems can be used for teaching both science and mathematical modeling. Create one or more simple eco-systems that include inter-dependent plants and animals. Example eco-systems include rain forest, desert, plains, pond, or coral reef. The eco-systems can include "real" weather based on current or historical weather data and can also include water-ways, pollution levels, and human-created structures such as buildings and roads. An important aspect of this project is to include ways to impact the eco-system by simulating natural disasters, new construction, invasive species, or disease. A nice additional feature would be some easy-to-use in-world data recording tools so that students can record observations, graph results, and share this data with others. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

In addition, there are a number of audio-related features that would be particularly useful: a [[#Hand_held_Microphone_small][hand-held microphone]] to amplify audience members without requiring them to move, the ability to turn on and off amplification of the presenter, and the ability to mute and unmute the audience. Video of the presentation streamed to the web would be another possible feature in this kit.

A better idea might be to develop an RTSP server in Wonderland and then, rather than creating JPEGs, add the captured images to that stream.

For a more challenging project, create a Facebook application that shows a snapshot of a person's personal 3D space and allows visitors to enter that space. The Facebook application would keep track of the number of users to limit access to space and display in-world activity on the Facebook page. The application would also include a simple configuration tool for generating the space in the first place, allowing users to select color and perhaps a wall paper pattern. Other configuration options might include specifying who is allowed to enter the space and what permissions those people have (eg, move objects, place new objects, delete objects, etc.). A "create world" button would automatically generate the new space. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

Ambient displays subtly modify some aspect of the environment (ie, walls, floors, doors, colors, textures, window views, lighting, object shapes or sizes, animation speed, size or color) in order to provide status information in an unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing manner.  Some ideas include changing "weather" outside the windows, changing wall or floor colors, or slowly morphing a virtual sculpture based on a web feed or other data source such as a company's stock price, the state of an open source build, or a building's power consumption for the day.  %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

The display could have a "contact" button which could initiate a voice chat or could teleport you to the person's virtual office door. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

Another potential idea is to allow users to instruct their avatars to walk automatically to nearby 'interesting' artifacts such as the nearest person, application, or chair. Avatars could automatically adjust the speed at which they walk based on their distance to the objective. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

---+++ Real-time Data Capture for More Expressive Avatars (large)

| *Description* | In virtual worlds it's often difficult to tell how remote people are reacting. If we could capture real data from the humans driving the avatars, it would be possible to make avatars much more responsive. Here are just a few examples. With a simple eye tracker, you could properly position an avatar's head to show what the human is looking at in the world. A laptop camera could capture head gestures and facial expressions. A seat sensor could trigger presence information, figuring out when a person is around or away. A motion sensor and accelerometer on a wristwatch could potentially detect certain arm gestures and translate those into avatar animations. A speech detector could automatically set an avatar's state to busy. A simple thermometer could change the in-world scenery to either match the real world climate or be the opposite (on cold days, a person might want to see a warm beach outside their virtual window :-) %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

| *Comments* | I think I get at what you're trying to say.  That is, non verbal communication is as important in a virtual environment as it is in the real world.  The challenge is to capture that in a non-intrusive (real world) way.  Ideally someone who wants to interact with the virtual world should be able to do so without having to use cumbersome headsets or data gloves, etc. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |

| *Description* | Virtual environments are often static places. Using sensor data or other dynamic data feeds from the web, dynamically change attributes of the world. For example, a simple thermometer could change the in-world scenery to either match the real world climate or be the opposite (on cold days, a person might want to see a warm beach outside their virtual window. In another example, environmental sensors monitoring water quality, air quality, etc. could be used to change parameters in the 3D world, either alerting people to dangers, calling them to action, or simply reflecting the current conditions. %EDITCELL{textarea, 10x60}% |
