<p>
When the voice bridge is started, there are many messages logged
and it is difficult for a new user to determine if it came up 
successfully or not.
<p>
There shouldn't be any exceptions in the bridge log.
<p>
If you see this message:
<p>
ERROR:  InvalidArgumentException javax.sip.InvalidArgumentException: Address already in use
<p>
then either voice bridge is already running
or some other program is using the SIP Port (usually 5060).
You will need to kill the program using that SIP Port.
<p>
Important messages you should see:
<p>
Bridge started in location "location"
<p>
Other messages which are harmless:
<p>
WARNING: At least one SIP gateway should be specified using 
    -Dcom.sun.voip.server.VoIPGateways. 
     Outgoing calls to PSTN will not work.
<p>
 module path '/home/jp/jvoicebridge/voip/modules/' is not a directory.  Ignoring.
<p>
If the voice bridge is started before the darkstar server,
messages will appear indicating that the voice bridge is unable
to notify the darkstar server that a bridge is online.
This is not a problem.  The bridge will retry once a second to connect
to the darkstar server.
