    <b>Prerequisites</b></a>
    
    <p>This page describes how to install a Wonderland server from a binary "jar" file. This is an activity we recommend for system administrators, software developers, or advanced users. After installing a binary build, you will end up with an instance of a Wonderland server, including a web server component and several default Wonderland worlds. You will be able to provide users with a link to a web page which has a button to launch a Wonderland client.<br><br>
    
     <b>Important Note:</b> Even if you have successfully run a Wonderland client on your system, you may still need to upgrade Java to be able to run the Wonderland server. See the "Java SE 6 JDK" bullet below.</p>
        
    <p>
    Before you download and install the binary release of Project Wonderland, make sure you have met the
	following requirements:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Supported Operating Systems</b>: Windows XP/Vista, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), OpenSolaris, Mac OS X<br><br>
        If Wonderland does not seem to run on your system, see the note below on <a href="#platforms">platform exceptions</a>.<br><br>
        
        <li><b>Access to a command line</b><br><br>
        You will need to know how to use a terminal or command window to enter a few simple commands.<br><br>
        
        <li><b>Java SE 6 JDK</b><br><br>
        
		To set up a Wonderland server you need the Sun Java SE 6 JDK. If you already have Java installed 
		verify that you have the JDK and not the JRE and that it's the Sun Java SE 6 version. Some
		Linux distributions include OpenJDK which is not compatible with Wonderland.<br><br>
		
		To verify that you have the Sun Java SE 6 JDK installed, follow these platform specific instructions:<br><br>
		
		<b>Linux and OpenSolaris</b><br><br>
		
                Check to see if you have a <b>/usr/jdk</b> or <b>/usr/jdk1.6.0_<i>nn</i></b> directory (where <i>nn</i>
                is a number such as 16). If you do, enter the following command to check the version you have installed:<br><br>
		
		<code>/usr/jdk/bin/java -version</code><br><br>

                or:<br><br>

                <code>/usr/jdk1.6.0_<i>nn</i>/bin/java -version</code><br><br>
		
                If you have the Sun Java SE 6 JDK installed, you should see <b>1.6.0</b> in the command output:<br><br>
		
		<code>
                java version "<b>1.6.0</b>_16"<br>
		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_16-b01)<br>
		Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 14.2-b01, mixed mode)
		</code><br><br>
		
		<b>Windows</b><br><br>
		
		Check to see if you have a <b>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<i>nn</i></b> directory. If you're 
		running a 64-bit version of Windows, also check <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_<i>nn</i></b>.
		<br><br>
		
		<b>Mac OS X</b><br><br>
		
                The JDK comes pre-installed on most Macs, so you should already have it, but you need to be sure
		that Java SE 6 is set as the active Java version.  Go to <b>Applications > Utilities > Java Preferences</b>, 
		and make sure that "Java SE 6" is first on the list under "Java Applications." If not, drag "Java SE 6"
		to the top of the list<br><br>
		
		If you don't see "Java SE 6" in the list, you will need to upgrade the version of Java installed on 
		your system. 
		
		Note: Apple only provides the Java 6 JDK for recent 64-bit systems. If you have an older 32-bit
		system you will not be able to run the Wonderland server on your system.<br><br>
		
		<b>Installing the Sun Java SE 6 JDK</b><br><br>
		
		If you are running a 64-bit operating system, please refer to the <a href="#platforms">platform exceptions</a> section for important notes on selecting the correct JDK.<br><br>
		
		If you have a version of the JDK earlier than 1.6.0, then you will need to download the Sun Java SE 6 
		JDK from here:<br><br>
		
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a><br><br>
		
		Scroll down the page until you see "Java SE Development Kit (JDK)" and download the current update
		of the JDK 6 for your platform.<br><br>
		
		<b>Mac OS X:</b> To download Java SE 6, follow these instructions:<br><br>
		
		<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3649">http://suport.apple.com/kb/HT3649</a><br><br>
	</ul>
    
    <a name="install">
    <b>Installing a Binary Build</b></a>
    <p>If you are installing the User Preview 1 release, please begin with Step 3 below. For nightly builds, please follow this entire set of instructions</p>
    <p>Each night (US Pacific time), a new Wonderland binary build is created. These are known as the "nightly builds," or simply as a "nightly." To install a nightly, follow these steps:    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to <a href="http://download.java.net/lg3d/wonderland/daily-0.5-dev/">http://download.java.net/lg3d/wonderland/daily-0.5-dev/</a><br><br>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the date you want.<br><br>
        Typically you will click on the last folder in the list, which is the most recent nightly build <br><br>
        <li>Right click on "Wonderland.jar" and save it to your computer.<br><br>
        <i>Note:</i> Do not change the name of the jar file when you save it. If you want to keep track of which nightly is which, create a folder and name it with the date of the nightly. Then save the jar file in that folder. The jar files are large, so the download will take some time.<br><br>
        <li>Open a terminal or command window.<br><br>
        <li>Change directory to the location where you downloaded the jar file.<br><br>
        <li>Start the Wonderland server on Mac OS or OpenSolaris by typing:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <code>java -jar Wonderland.jar</code>
            </ul><br>
        On Windows, type the following, including the quotation marks, but replace the "_16" with the number of the update that you have installed:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <code>"\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin\java" -jar Wonderland.jar</code>
            </ul><br>
        If you have a 64-bit system, the java command might be located in a different directory, in which case you need to type a variation of the command, again replacing the "_16" if necessary:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <code>"\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin\java" -jar Wonderland.jar</code>
            </ul><br>         
        <b>NOTE:</b> For Linux and Ubuntu systems, it is recommended you manually configure the IP address of the server. See the <a href="#config-options">Configuration Options</a> section below for further instructions.<br><br>
            
        <li>Be patient while the Wonderland server starts up.<br><br>
        You should soon see lots of messages fly by in the terminal window, including lots of warnings. Expect some pauses. The process will take a minute or two.<br><br>
        <li>Eventually you will see a message that includes the text "Wonderland web server started successfully."<br><br>
        The entire message will look something like this:<br><br>
            <code>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Wonderland web server started successfully.<br>
Log files are in /Users/username/.wonderland-server/0.5-dev/log<br>
Web server running on http://myserver:8080/<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------
            </code>
			<br><br>
        <li>Make a note of the log file directory.<br><br>
        You will need this information when you wish to delete this build from your computer. In addition, this directory may contain useful information for reporting Wonderland problems.<br><br>
        <li>Copy and paste the URL in the last line of the message into a browser window to navigate to the Wonderland launch page.<br><br> 
        This is the URL you can give to end users to launch Wonderland.<br><br>
        <li>Click the "Launch" button on the web page.
    </ol>
    
    <br><a name="shutdown">
    <b>Shutting Down the Wonderland Server</b></a>
    <p>
    When you run Wonderland following the instructions above, the Wonderland server will stay running until you stop it. To stop the server, find the terminal window where you started it and type "Ctrl-C" to end the process. Closing the terminal window or shutting down the terminal program will have the same effect, so be careful to leave the window open and the terminal program running for as long as you or anyone else is still using Wonderland.</p>
    
    <br><a name="config-options">
    <b>Configuration Options</b></a>
    <p>
    For most installations, there's no need to configure the Wonderland software, but if you have properties you would like to change, you can add them at the command line. For example:</p>
    
    <ul>
<code>java -Dwonderland.webserver.host=localhost -jar Wonderland.jar</code>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Or you can pass in a properties file as an argument:</p>

    <ul>
<code>java -jar Wonderland.jar my.run.properties</code>
    </ul>
    
    <br><a name="uninstall">
    <b>Uninstalling Wonderland</b></a>
    <p>
    To uninstall the Wonderland binary distribution from your machine, perform the following steps:
    
    <ol>
        <li>Delete the Wonderland.jar file.<br><br>
        If you placed the jar file in a directory with the date of the build, delete the directory.<br><br>
        <li>Delete the directory <code>~/.wonderland-server/[version-number]</code>.<br><br>
        The "~" notation means your home directory. The complete directory name was printed in your terminal window when you started the Wonderland server (see the log file location in Step 8 above). 
    </ol>
    
    <br><a name="next">
    <b>What's Next?</b></a>
    <p>
    There are a number of additional configuration steps you might be interested in, depending on how you plan 
    to deploy Project Wonderland. The following articles and tutorials cover more advanced configuration options:

    <b>Platform Exceptions</b></a>
	
    <ul>
	
	<p><b>64-bit Operating Systems</b><br>
	If you have a 64-bit operating system (other than Mac OS), you must install the 32-bit version of the Sun Java SE 6 JDK
	to run the Wonderland server. The Wonderland server is not compatible with the 64-bit JDK.<br><br>
	
	If you just want to run the Wonderland client, you can use the 32-bit or 64-bit JRE. You don't need 
	the JDK to run the client.

    <p><b>Mac OS</b><br> 
    Apple only provides a 64-bit Java SE JRE/JDK, so you must have a 64-bit system (hardware). Note that
	the 32-bit server restriction above doesn't apply to Mac OS. The Wonderland server will run on the 64-bit
	JDK on Mac OS.
	</p>

    <p><b>Windows</b><br>
    Wonderland's Glassfish application server fails to find the JDK even if you set the JAVA_HOME environment
	variable. Please use the following workaround, adjusting the paths according to your Java installation:</p>
    <ul>
        <code>"\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin\java" -Djava.home="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16" -jar Wonderland.jar</code>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Linux</b><br>
    Some Linux distributions include the OpenJDK which is not compatible with Wonderland. You must
	install the Sun Java SE 6 JDK. It's a good idea to uninstall OpenJDK. You can do this with the 
	Package Manager. Search for "openjdk-6" and uninstall all packages with this prefix.
    <p>
