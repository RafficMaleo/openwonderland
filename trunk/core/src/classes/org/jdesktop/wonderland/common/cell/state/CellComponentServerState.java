 * The CellComponentServerState class is the base class for the cell configuration
 * (setup) information for all cell components. Individual cell components may
 * be mixed into cells to give them added functionality: subclasses of this
 * class provide the necessary configuration information.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism used JAXB to serialize and deserialize objects to/from XML.
 * Each subclass of CellSetupComponent must be annotated with @XmlRootElement
 * which gives the name that encapsulates the component-specific XML setup
 * information. Within the root element, the subclass component is free to
 * design its own XML schema for its setup information, typically using the
 * @XmlElement and @XmlAttribute annotations.
 * <p>
 * Each subclass of CellComponentServerState must declare itself with the mechanism
 * annotated JAXB classes, by implementing the CellSetupAPI interface.
